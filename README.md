## General
This student project is an implementation of a dominating set for graph. The main goal is to learn algorithm on graphs and a first overview of them. 

## Config
Config needed to execute this project:
* OS: Linux/Unix
* GCC: 12.2.0(used here)

## Usage
After cloning the project on your machine.
Run the command below in the directory:

```bash
$ gcc test_graph.c graph.c

```
It will generate an executable file(a.out), execute it:

```bash
$ ./a.out

```

After the command, your console should prompt you the dominating set and create a new text file called "print_graph.txt". The text file contain a representation of the graph.
